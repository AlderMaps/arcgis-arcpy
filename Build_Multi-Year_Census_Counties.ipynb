    "# Census County GIS Data Cross-Year Exploration\n",
    "\n",
    "This Python (ArcPy) script arose from the data exploration phase of an ArcGIS script + Dashboard project begun in summer 2025 (at the beginning of my post-[Deferred Resignation Program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_U.S._federal_deferred_resignation_program) professional gap year[ish]).\n",
    "\n",
    "The project centers on an ArcGIS Dashboard that displays FEMA US county Disaster Declarations, and is powered by a script that automatically updates the map on a daily basis. This Dashboard promises to be a near-real-time, interactive version of static PDFs I often made for USDA HSD (Homeland Security Division) personnel with whom I worked while I was with USDA GEO (which is the role I exited via [DRP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_U.S._federal_deferred_resignation_program)).\n",
    "\n",
    "This Dashboard has at its core a simple dataset comprising US county geographies (which are joined to FEMA Disaster Declaration data via FIPS codes). I know from my work with USDA—specifically from my partnership on multiple projects with FSA—that FIPS codes do occasionally change from year to year. (An unusual and somewhat extreme example is the [shake-up of Connecticut counties in 2022](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/06/06/2022-12063/change-to-county-equivalents-in-the-state-of-connecticut)).\n",
    "\n",
    "If I want to represent FEMA Disaster Declaration data across multiple years, I must ensure that my US county data reflects all FIPS codes from the same span of years. If, for example, I simply used the most recent US Counties dataset from US Census Bureau, any Disaster Declarations from before 2022 for Connecticut (specifically, County FIPS codes from before 2022) would not join to post-2022 counties, and those Declarations would therefore not be reflected in my Dashboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "This Python script therefore represented an interest on my part in discovering just how many FIPS codes have changed within my temporal range of data interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "I also know from my time with USDA that US County geographies are also subject to occasional change. Often these changes are small, e.g. an adjustment along a migrating meandering river. Nevertheless I figure I may as well explore the US county geography changes as long as I am already programmatically mucking about in the guts of US county geodatabases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional ulterior motives: I don't really have an updated (Python 3.x) script in my GIS Portfolio which primary purpose is mucking about in the guts of geodatabases: data access cursors and all that. And, finally: Python is just obscenely fun.\n",
    "\n",
    "P.S. This script took two days to put together. The ONLY thing ChatGPT helped with was clueing me into the existence of the \"template\" parameter for the ArcPy .CreateFeatureclass() method."
